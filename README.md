## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @nevemlaci

My name is LÃ¡szlÃ³ LipÃ³di, or Laci for short.<br> 
Iâ€™m currently studying Computer Engineering at Budapest University of Technology and Economics. 

I mainly develop simple libraries in C++, but I also had a small venture into C# trough the Unity API and MAUI.
My first few projects were written in C++ using the C library SDL2, and to this day I use the library for some projects.
